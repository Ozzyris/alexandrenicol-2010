				<p>Even if today my main interest is around software and mobile application, I spent a long part of my career working on marketing website. In 2016 when I got hired at Experience Digital, the company just started a major rebranding. My first job was to design and build a new marketing website who would carry our new values. The website had to showcase our capabilities in term of design and development.</p>

				<p>For this project, I was lucky to have a large degree of freedom. We decide to start the design process by laying down the goal we were hoping to achieve. From there we chose 3 brand colours, one for each of the core activities we wanted to emphasize: Design, Website & Web-application.  Around these colours, we created illustration and iconography. Once we were happy with this direction, I created 3 pages flowing down a single template. We continue the work by adding case studies, interview and other pages.</p>

				<p>For the build itself, we choose to implement a classic CodeIgniter framework. From there we focused on creating dynamic animations and transitions using SVG and CSS3. Over time new features were added to the website like a blog, but thanks to a scalable design and development technic we were able to save a lot of time.</p>
