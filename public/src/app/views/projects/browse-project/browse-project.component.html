				<p>Freelancer.com browse project page is the 2nd most visited page on the website, with its average 300k monthly views. It was the single most complex page I had to work on. And yet when you look at it the page seem deadly simple. A list of project card and a choice of filters. The truth is because of its high traffic every single choice had to be a conscious one, backed up by surveys, interviews and testing. </p>
				<img src="../../assets/images/ILLU_project_carrott_2.jpg" alt="People using the carrott phone app.">
				<p>When we started this project Freelancer.com had 6 different versions of the same page. Over the 10 years, duplicate version of this page had been built, either adding a new features or trying to solve something. They where all different. So we listed all of their features, and our competitor features, and the feature we had from interviews and survey we sent over time. Then we sent a survey to 30k users asking them to rank these features. We learned that the description was the most important component of the page. Far above the price or any other feature. So we increase the overall size of the description.</p>

				<p>Once selected and ranked, we had to create this card who would keep them together. Keeping in mind than if the card was too long, our user would see less project for the same scroll. But show too little, and a user might dismiss his perfect project. The card had to be simple enough to be understood by every user at first sight, and flexible enough to display any kind of project on any type of support. Less is more. We removed everything who was not necessary from the card. At the end we only had text, icon, upgrade tag and space.</p>

				<p>And it work, We were able to fit everything, keep all the features we wanted following a clear hierarchy. We A/B test the page who showed a positive uplift from our user. They were staying longer, scrolling more and ultimately bidding more. Following this success we worked on updating the other similar card following the same structure. The freelancer profile card, the user review card, and all the other. As a designer it was frustrating to spend so much time in so little, and when seeing the result it might seems like a 5 minutes job by a intern, but as we say "Good design is invisible". It was also a really fruitful exercise.</p>
