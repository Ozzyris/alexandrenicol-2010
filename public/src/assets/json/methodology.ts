I do so by conducting interviews and sending survey whenever possible. From this first interaction I write down what I believe is their needs and wishes. At the same time I do my best to see all the implications of the project. This research brings the first wave of inspiration and the first glimpse of ideas.',

The research phase often come with its own set of hypothesis, not always the best and often quite hard to dismiss. At that point I find it useful to involve other designers and project manager to get their ideas and opinion on the project. From this brainstorms we often get a large amount of hypothesis which we use as a base to draw our concepts. ',

		description: 'The previous steps brought us a good set of hypothesis. From there my job is to find cluster between them. Not all of them can be integrated into a project, by finding cluster we find a way to integrate the hypothesis with the higher values to us. To maximise this process, I work by short period of time, usually 5 min, to draw links between hypothesis and build concepts around them. After some iteration a clear concept draws itself from the most interesting cluster.',

Few more iterations later and we usually have a solid base to start building our minimum viable product.',
