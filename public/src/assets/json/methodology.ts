By this interaction I determine their needs and wishes. In the same time I do my best to see all the implications of the project in question. Sometime by leading an internet survey, or using tools like twitter and by creating personas of the typical user. This research bring inspiration and the first glimpse of an ideas.',

		description: 'When I found a compatible persona for the final user I begin the ideation phase. Often during the research phase an idea comes and if feels like it is not possible to find a better one, and most of the time this is not the best idea. It’s a common problem to all type of design, and quite a few process exist to move forward. At that time I like to switch side and start looking for the worst way possible to answer the problem, need a new type of food delivery, what about a random dishes you don’t choose? Then I use this bad idea evolving into a better, then a good idea, like a discover weekly of meal. By this way I assure myself a quantity of ideas, I would not usually think of.',

		description: 'When I accumulate a correct amount of interesting ideas, I start defining cluster of similar idea. Usually the best way to do so is to write them on post it and search for the links sometime they are obvious, sometime it’s necessary to extrapolate on possible combination of ideas. To develop those ideas into concepts I push myself to draw a maximum of concepts in a 5 to 10 min sessions. From those first level concepts I pick up some more of them and draw another session. After an hour or two I usually pick up 2 - 3 very interesting concepts.',

Thanks to this method we can found dead end before we invest too much time in one concept. By explaining this workflow to colleagues it is quite fast and easy to iterate the concept to a better version.',

		description: 'As I can now ensure the potential of each concept, I start designing low fidelity wireframe for each screen or element of the project. No style of content are user just block and fake text to simulate the final result. Once it’s done we animate these wireframe into an Invision prototype that offers an interactive result. We often test these prototype in intern and with the final user to confirm our hypothesis. In some case more complex prototype are needed and then build with framework like Angular 2. With the feedbacks gathered I can choose the most interesting concept the the previous selection and start the development phase.',

The choice of the technology is made in function of the objective we want to reach and the budget of the client. When this MVP is launched I follow the project and start the development of the secondary feature.',
